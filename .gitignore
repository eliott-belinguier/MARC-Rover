# Ignore all files and directories related to the IntelliJ IDEA project settings.
# These files are specific to your development environment and are not needed by other developers.
# Sharing these files can also cause conflicts if team members use different configurations.

# Ignore all directories starting with "cmake-build-".
# These are typically auto-generated build directories created by CMake.
# They often contain compiled binaries, temporary files, and build artifacts
# that should not be tracked in the repository.

# Ignore all object files with the ".o" extension.
# These files are intermediate compilation outputs produced by compilers like GCC.
# Object files are not source code and can be regenerated during the build process,
# so tracking them in version control is unnecessary and can bloat the repository.
